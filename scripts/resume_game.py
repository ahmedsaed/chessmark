"""Reopen a game the harness stopped.

    make resume GAME=<id> USD=1.50

Only endings **Chessmark** imposed can be reopened — a budget, its own ply cap, a provider it
could not reach. A checkmate is final, and so is a forfeit: both are findings about a player, and
un-ending one would let a bad result be replayed until it improved. The refusal is the point of
this script existing rather than a hand-edited `UPDATE`.

Appends a `game_resumed` event, so the reason a finished game started moving again is in the same
log everything else reads (ADR-0008, invariant 7).
